            <p><b>The amount of energy in food or drink is measured in calories.</b></p>
            <p>You need energy from calories for your body to work properly. Your body uses this energy to function properly.</p>
            <p>To stay at around the same weight, the calories your body uses should be the same as the amount of calories you eat and drink.</p>
            <p>If you do not use the same amount of calories as you eat and drink, your body weight may change. For example:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>you're likely to put on weight if you eat and drink more calories than you use. This is because your body stores the extra energy as fat</li>
            <li>you're likely to lose weight if you eat and drink fewer calories than you use. This is because your body uses its stored fat for energy</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Calorie information is often given in kcals, which is short for kilocalories. It may also be given in kJ, which is short for kilojoules.</p>
            <p>As a guide:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>An average man needs 2,500kcal a day</li><li>an average woman needs 2,000kcal a day
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>This could be different based on your:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Age</li>
            <li>Weight</li>
            <li>height</li>
            <li>How much exercise you do</li>
            </ul>
